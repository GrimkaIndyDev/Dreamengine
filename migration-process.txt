Migration process:

- datas/imagesDatas.js
  > replace "folderName" by "baseUrl"
  > in images declaration, you must remove the extension and precise it in the image path, like this
    [ "resourceName", "resource/path", "png" ]
    become
    [ "resourceName", "resource/path.png" ]
  > the imagesList must be changed to "main" and pushed inside an object named "pools" like this
  before: imagesList: [ /* datas */ ]
  now: pools: { main: [ /* datas */ ] }
    
- CircleRenderer
  > all parameters go inside an object, just one parameters with all inside, for radius name it radius in the parameters object
  > fillColor stay, strokeColor become lineColor

- BoxRenderer become RectRenderer
  > all parameters go inside an object, just one parameters with all inside, for width height name it width/height in the parameters object
  > strokeColor become lineColor

- TextRenderer
  > text value is the first argument now
  > all parameters go inside an objectjust as before
  > you don't need anymore to precise width/height
  > all calls to "setText" must be changed by text = "value"

- GameObjects
  > You can now directly set x/y/z without calling position.
  > "childrens" mistake is fixed and renamed to gameObjects (do changes if you called "childrens" somewhere)

- Render
  > You have to precise a width/height waiting for a new version handling this as the previous one
  > , width: 1920, height: 1080
  > set a background color on the render (not working on the camera)
