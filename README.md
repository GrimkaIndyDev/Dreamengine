Dream-Engine V2 - a simple and powerful 2D game engine using PIXI V4
===========
The Dream-Engine is a free open source engine to create HTML5 games.
This brand new version is based on [PIXI V4](http://www.pixijs.com/).

It give you a powerful and simple declaration, logic, inputs binding, achievements management, audio library and so on.

If you want to use PIXI but don't want to code everything you need aside, you should try the DreamEngine.

Not usable yet
===========
I decided to make my engine from scratch again to be able to use 100% of what PIXI have to offer.
Right now the engine is not usable, I will update readme as I code it (again).

If you want to use the DreamEngine check the branch v_0.26 (using PIXI V3).
